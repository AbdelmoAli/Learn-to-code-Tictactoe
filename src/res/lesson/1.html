If you read this, it's because you wish to learn python by coding a game: TicTacToe!

In this lesson, I'll teach you the first things you need to know about the language Python, in order to write your first function:

- the first variables: Integer, String, List
- how to write a function

<h2>Let's Begin!</h2>Let's Begin!

The Python language uses different data types, that uses different operations. The first type is the Integer type. If you're not 
bad in mathematics,
you should know about the common operations you can do with integers: addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*), and 
division (-).
Well, in Python you can use those different operations with the integers. But you can do a lot more! If you want to know more, 
check a documentation
on the internet. For now, that is more than enough to continue our lesson.

The second data type that we'll talk about is the String type. More than simple, a String is juste a succession of characters 
that forms
a word, a sentence, a paragraph or a whole book. Exemples: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;word&quot;, &quot;this is a 
sentence&quot; are strings. As you notice, strings are 
always written between &quot;&quot;. That's how Python understand you're writing a string.

The last data type you'll need for the first function is the List type. A list is a set of datas

<h2>How to declare a variable? </h2>
my_variable = value
You just enter this line of code in your shell, and our_variable will now contain the type and value of "value" 
(Integer, String, List..)

<h2>What about functions?</h2>
A function takes parameters (that can be Integers, Strings, Lists,..), does some actions and return a new value. 
The syntax of a function is as following:

def function(parameter1, parameter2):
    ---some actions..
    .. 
    ..---
    return output1, output2..
