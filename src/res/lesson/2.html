        <h1> Lesson 2: List and index </h1>
        
    In this lesson you learn more about lists and you'll get one step closer to building the game. One of the most important features
    of the list structure is that it allows you to access to any element, on the condition that you know it's rank in the list.
    For instance, imagine that you have a list first_integers that contain the first 10 non-negative integers (from 1 to 10). To get the number 8
    you will just need the identify its rank (remember that the first element of a list has allows rank 0). So here number 8 eight has
    rank 7 and therefore to extract it from the list you'll need to write the following:
    
    first_nonnegative[7]

    Furthermore, you can even iterate this process when you have a list of lists. For instance, if you have a list called list_of_lists 
    containing three lists and you want to call the element of rank 2 in the list of rank 1, just type:
    
    list_of_lists[1][2]

    Now, you know enough to write a function called &quot;value&quot; that returns the content of square in a grid. It will take three
    parameters: the grid and the position of of the square in the grid which is given by two non-negative integers i and j.
