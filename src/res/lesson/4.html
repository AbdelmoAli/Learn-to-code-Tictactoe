        <h1> Lesson 4: Modify a grid </h1>

    In this lesson, you already have all the tools to succeed ! I just want you to write a function called
    add_mark that takes a grid and two integers i,j and a mark (it can be either &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot;)
    and puts the mark in the square of index (i,j). Remember that variables can be modified! Access to the square 
    and modify it !
