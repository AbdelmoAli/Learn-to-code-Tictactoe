        <h1> Lesson 6: the or statement</h1>
    In this lesson you will just need to  write a easy function that checks if you have a winning combination in your grid.
    We will call it is_align and it will take a row ( i.e a list) and returns whether it's contains three identical marks.
    You can use the following syntax:
    
    if cond1 or cond2:
       operation1
    else:
       operation2
    
    Hint: you will need to use the 'or'
