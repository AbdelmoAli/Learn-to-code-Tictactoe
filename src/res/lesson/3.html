        <h1> Lesson 3: introduction to booleans</h1>
    
    In this lesson, you will need to learn about booleans. Booleans in python is a type containing two object : True or False.
    Whenever you ask a python a question, he will answer with True or False. The first question you will learn to ask is to ask
    whether two objects are equal. Here's how you do:

    object_1 == object_2

    Python will systematically answer with True or False. Now, use this to write a function calle is_empty that takes a grid and
    two integers i and j and ask python whether the square in position (i,j) is empty. Don't forget to return rhe answer ;D
