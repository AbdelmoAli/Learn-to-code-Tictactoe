        <h1> Lesson 10: It's time to say goodbye </h1>
    Well there you are on the finish line ! One more function and you're good to go !
    Your last effort will be to write a function called is_full that take a grid a parameter and returns a boolean True or False 
    whether every square is full or not. I'll suggest you create a variable called result containing initially the boolean True
    and then use a double for loop to check each square and update th varaible result depending the value of the square.
