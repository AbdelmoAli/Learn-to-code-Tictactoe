        <h1> Lesson 7: Boss level - tricky use of indexation</h1>
    
    This is the boss level. We want you to perform a crucial task : write a function call get extract every row and every column and the two diagonals
    from the grid. Each one will be a list and the answer will be a list of these lists. So let's go through this step by step.
    First, you will need to learn how to concatenate two lists. Here's how you would add [1,2] and [3,4] to get 
    a list new_list equal to [1,2,3,4]:

    new_list = [1,2]+[3,4]

    In general, you will write :

    new_list = list_1 + list_2

    You can also keep the variable list_1 and grow it by adding the elements of list_2:

     list_1+=list_2

    list_1 now contains the original elements followed by the elements of list_2.

    So you'll first create a variable called rows  containing an empty list and then get all the rows from the 
    grid using &quot;+=&quot; you'll write something like this:

    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
        rows+=[...]

    Now you want to get the columns. You will basically write the same code with a slight permutation of index, i'll 
    let you guess where ;P

    Now you want to extract the diagonal. Use an other for loop and remember that an element of the diagonale is indexed
    by the identitical integers (i,i)...

    Now you want to extract the anti-diagonal, i.e squares of index (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Try a for loop that does it
    with right indexing. Hint : try to figure the relation between the two cordinate !
