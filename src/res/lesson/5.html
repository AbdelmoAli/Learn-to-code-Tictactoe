        <h1> Lesson 5: if statement </h1>
    In this lesson, you will need to learn how to perform a certain operations under certain conditions. In the context 
    of python, conditions means if a certain test returns True or False. Suppose that you have a test called my_test that
    returns True and you want to perform a task that depends on the success of this test. Here's how you would do it:

    If my_test == True :
        operation
    
    for instance here's a simple example:
    
    If 3<=2:
        print(2)
    
    Here python won't print 2 because the test following the if returns True. But you can perform a task even when the if
    statement is False. You use the else synthax and print(2) anyway.

    If 3<=2:
       print(2)
    else:
        print(2)
    
    Now I want you to write a function called switch that takes a mark ( i.e a string, either &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot;) and
    does the following operation : if the the mark is a cross, it return an O and vice versa. You can use an if... else statement 
    to do perform it !
